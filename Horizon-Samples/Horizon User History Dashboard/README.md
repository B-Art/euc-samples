VMware vRealize Dashboard for Horizon User History
<!-- Summary End -->

VROPs for Horizon provides end-to-end visibility into key User session statistics that make it easy for Horizon admins to visualize and alert on performance problems impacting the users of their environment. One of the key metrics used in determining how well users are connected to their virtual app or desktop session is Session Latency (ms), as it most visually impacts the users perspective of their session performance.  The lower the session latency, the quicker video, keyboard, and mouse inputs are redirected to and from a users endpoint client, giving the user a more native-like PC experience.
