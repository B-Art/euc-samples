## Overview
<!-- Summary Start -->
VMware vRealize LogInsight Dashboard for Horizon 8 application information.
<!-- Summary End -->

After using the official Omnissa Horizon content pack I found I was lacking some information around application launches. Workspace one has this information but I wanted to recreate it in loginsight based on the logs from connection server events. I built a handful of extractors and a dashboard to do this and wanted to share with the community.
