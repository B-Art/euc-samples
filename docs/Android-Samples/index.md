| WS1-Profile-CustomSettings-Android-Reference-App | This application is useful for demonstrating how to retrieve values from a Workspace ONE UEM MDM profile. These values can be used throughout an Android application, and eliminate the need to build separate applications with different hardcoded values. This allows the use of key value pairs (KVP) in a custom settings profile payload to be read by the restrictions manager Android class. | [Link](https://github.com/euc-dev/euc-samples/Android-Samples/WS1-Profile-CustomSettings-Android-Reference-App) |
