# euc-samples

## Introduction

Welcome to the Omnissa **euc-samples** repository.  This project is intended for the community and Omnissa to share commonly used code snippets, sample apps, scripts and sensors that can aid Workspace ONE and Horizon administrators. 

Some examples of items to submit for consideration and use by the community:

* Custom XML Profile Payloads
* Script content for Custom Attributes
* Scripts to be leveraged via WS1 Scripts (Bash/shell, Python, Powershell, Batch, etc)
* Scripts to assist with automation against the various REST API's
* Markdown Documents describing suggested best practices or procedures that may be outside the realm of typical documentation

## Downloads

By downloading, installing, or using the Software, you agree to be bound by the terms of the License Agreement unless there is a different license provided in or specifically referenced by the downloaded file or package. If you disagree with any terms of the agreement, then do not use the Software.

## developer.omnissa.com

This repo is structured to feed into the [https://developer.omnissa.com](http://developer.omnissa.com) Developer Portal via the [](https://github.com/euc-dev/euc-dev.github.io) repo using MkDocs published by GitHub Pages. An index of all scripts, snippets, tools, sensors etc is automatically generated and stored within the `/docs` folder. Do not modify this folder. 

This folder is integrated into the [Developer Portal repo](https://developer.omnissa.com) automatically.

## Contributing to Samples

The **euc-samples** project team welcomes contributions from the community.

An index page is dynamically generated for each sample area and displayed within the [https://developer.omnissa.com](http://developer.omnissa.com) Developer Portal. 

As such, the submission must be placed in a new folder in the correct area and with the information included in the below example README.md:

!!!Note
    The `update-readme-summary-table.ps1` script is run on an as needed basis which reads the README.md for each application, utility or project and builds a summary table. Each sample, therefore requires its own folder and README.md file. The README.md file also needs to include a `<!-- Summary Start -->` and `<!-- Summary End -->` tag that surrounds desired the description or summary.

If the submission is a WS1 UEM Script or Sensor, then see the [Sensor README.md](./UEM-Samples/Sensors/README.md) and [Scripts README.md](./UEM-Samples/Scripts/README.md) for required information.

Workspace ONE UEM Scripts and Sensors have a dedicated index due to the number of samples within the [UEM-Samples/Sensors](https://github.com/euc-dev/euc-samples/tree/main/UEM-Samples/Sensors) and [UEM-Samples/Scripts](https://github.com/euc-dev/euc-samples/tree/main/UEM-Samples/Scripts) folders respectively, reading the `# Description:` field from each script or sensor.

**It is therefore important that when contributing samples, that the appropriate tags or fields are provided, otherwise the sample will not be included in the index.**

### Suggested Information

The following information should be included when possible. Inclusion of information provides valuable information to consumers of the resource.

* Product version against which the sample was developed/tested
* Client Operating System version against which the sample was developed/tested (e.g. Windows Build number, or macOS Version and Build Number)
* Language (Bash/Python/Powershell) version against which the sample was developed/tested

## Contribution Process

Please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/euc-oss/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Developer Certificate of Origin

Before you start working with euc-samples, please read our [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://github.com/euc-dev/.github/blob/main/Developer%20Certificate%20of%20Origin.md) document. All contributions to this repository must be signed as described on that page. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch.

## Code Style

We won't actively enforce any "official" style guides, but do ask that you do what you can to:
* Make your samples easily readable
* Make your samples easily reusable
* Include in-line comments to help with readability

## Resource Maintenance

### Maintenance Ownership

Maintenance of any and all submitted samples is to be performed by the community.  If you can make a sample better, please feel free to submit a pull request to improve it!

### Filing Issues

Any bugs or other issues should be filed within GitHub by way of the repositoryâ€™s Issue Tracker.

### Resolving Issues

Any community member can resolve issues within the repository, however only the Project Team can approve the update. Once approved, assuming the resolution involves a pull request, only a Project Team member will be able to merge and close the request.

### Windows Users

Some of the samples result in a long file path that may cause cloning to fail on Windows machines. If you an error message is displayed during cloning indicating that the file name is too long then run the below command to allow longer file names during checkout.
* ```git config --system core.longpaths true```
