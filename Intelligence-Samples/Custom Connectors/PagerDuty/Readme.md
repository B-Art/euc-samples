## Purpose
<!-- Summary Start -->
A sample of how PagerDuty APIs can be customized and used for Automation workflows in Workspace ONE Intelligence
<!-- Summary End -->

## Requirements

1. The latest version of [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) 
2. Workspace ONE Intelligence
3. A PagerDuty instance
4. An admin account in PagerDuty with the roles and permissions that allow generating a token for API access


## How to use this sample

This collection is a sample for use within Workspace ONE Intelligence.  Please be sure to populate all variable fields with the values from your instance. Including: BaseURL and Token.

Additionally, you can customize the requests to include fields that are required by your incident that may not be included in this collection by default.

To generate a Token for use with the API, follow these instructions to [Generate account API tokens](https://v2.developer.pagerduty.com/docs/authentication)

Properly creating an Incident requires:
* Updating the Authorization header to match the token value of your instance
* Updating the "service.id", "service.type", and "service.summary" to match that of the values in your instance.
