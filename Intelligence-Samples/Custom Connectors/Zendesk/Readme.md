## How to use this sample

This collection is a sample for use within Workspace ONE Intelligence.  Please be sure to populate all variable fields with the values from your instance. Including: BaseURL and Token.

**Permissions**
The *Create Ticket* API requires the *Agent* role.

**Authentication**
In most cases, you should be able to use *Basic Authentication* with the agent's username and password.

*Note:* If 2-factor authentication is enabled, you must use an API token or the OAuth flow. 

To use an API Token, use *Basic Authentication* and populate the username field with your `username` and the password field with `token:{api_token}`.

OAuth can be configured using the Intelligence *OAuth Authentication* type.

More information on authentication requirements can be found at [Zendesk API Security and Authentication ](https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/support/introduction#security-and-authentication)
